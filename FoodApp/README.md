## build food app

### 1. plan the page 
### 2. make the res-card dynamic by props.
       -> props: passing the argument to a function.
       -> props destructuring
       -> config driven UI : based on the different data , UI is designed according to the data given by the COnfig.
            -> ex: carousal is different for different city in food app.
### 3. make the res-card dynamic by json data,  
       -> always use a key, whenever looping the elements. 
          -> index as a key is not acceptable.
